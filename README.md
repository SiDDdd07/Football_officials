This project focuses on fine-tuning the sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6 model for the task of summarizing football commentary, specifically to extract concise information about match officials such as the referee, assistant referees, and VAR personnel. The model is trained on a custom dataset containing full-length match commentaries and corresponding summaries listing the officials involved in each game. By fine-tuning a lightweight version of BART (DistilBART), this approach achieves efficient performance while staying within GPU memory limits. The model is capable of generating structured summaries from unstructured football commentary, making it potentially useful for match reporting, broadcasting, or automation tasks in sports analytics.
